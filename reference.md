title: Reference Letters

If you are reading this page, it means you might be interested in asking me to write a reference letter for you. Though I would, in general, agree to write letters for students, here are some guidelines that you should know.

1. If I don't know you well, I usually can't write the letter for you. The reason is simple. If I don't know you well, I can't write a strong recommendation letter for you. A lukewarm recommendation letter usually doesn't help your application to graduate school or scholarship. For example, if you are a student in my class with hundreds of students, it will be hard for me to remember any particulars with you unless we have had lots of interactions after class (during office hours, coffee with the prof, dine with the prof, meet at student organization events, etc.). 
2. If you are one of my tutors, I would be happy to write a letter for you. But please follow the guidelines below
Please give me at least 3 weeks of notice before the earliest application deadline. I don't want to miss your deadline so give me enough time, please.

Please provide me a brief overview of your tutor experience. I know what you did, but I would like more details from you. Details may include specific tutoring experience, what you volunteered to help, what you did specially for the class when you were a tutor. 
Please contact me in advance if you want me to write a letter. Nov. to Dec. every year is the hot season for reference letters. Good luck with your application!
